# Installation

## Requirements
- Unity 2021.3 LTS or higher (Recommended)
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux editors.

## Option 1: Copy to Project (Recommended for local dev)

1. Download the latest release from the repository.
2. Unzip the package.
3. Copy the `Assets/SceneSizeAnalyzer` folder into your Unity project's `Assets/` directory.

## Option 2: Unity Asset Store (Coming Soon)
We are currently processing our submission to the Unity Asset Store. Once approved, you will be able to install it directly via the Package Manager.

## Verifying Installation
After installation, check the top menu bar in Unity. You should see:
`Tools > Scene Size Analyzer`

If you see this menu, the installation was successful.
