# Heatmap Visualization

Visualize object density directly in the Scene View.

## Enabling the Heatmap
1. Open the Scene Analyzer Window.
2. Toggle **"Show Heatmap"**.
3. In the Scene View, you will see colored overlays indicating object density.

## Legends
- **Green**: Low density (Safe)
- **Yellow**: Medium density (Caution)
- **Red**: High density (Optimization needed)

## Use Cases
- Identifying "cluttered" areas in a level design.
- Spotting hidden high-poly meshes causing overdraw.
